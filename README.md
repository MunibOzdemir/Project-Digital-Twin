## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with your own credentials:

API_USERNAME=your_username
API_PASSWORD=your_password


3. **Note:** The `.env` file is ignored by Git, so your credentials wonâ€™t be accidentally pushed to GitHub.

4. Run the project as usual. The credentials will be securely loaded from the `.env` file.
